# My config
I'm using mastercomfig medium-low, dx8, and the LOD tweak. I have a bunch of other mods, make an issue if you have any questions / help.

My actual cfg files (autoexec and class config) reside in fiona-custom/cfg/. I also have some stuff in my mastercomfig modules to get this to work.

compviewmodels.vpk should not be manually copied, instead, get the latest installed from yttrium's thread and configure it.

only_hitsound.vpk is a VPK which disables most sounds and leaves hitsounds (and a few others). Great for MGE or pubbing with music.
