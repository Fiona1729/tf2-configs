# My config
I'm using mastercomfig medium-low, dx8, and the LOD tweak. I have a bunch of other mods, make an issue if you have any questions / help.

My actual cfg files (autoexec and class config) reside in fiona-custom/cfg/

only_hitsound.vpk is a VPK which disables most sounds and leaves hitsounds (and a few others). Great for MGE or pubbing with music.
